 * Readiness, which is deliberately a different question from liveness.

 * `/api/health` above answers "is this process listening", and it is what the **liveness** probe asks.
 * Liveness must stay that shallow: a liveness probe that queries the database turns an outage into a
 * crash storm — every replica fails, gets killed, restarts, and fails again, and nothing recovers when
 * the database does.
 *
 * `/api/ready` answers "can this revision actually serve a request", and the database is most of that
 * answer. Without it the promotion gate proves only that Node is up, so a revision with a wrong
 * `DATABASE_URL`, an unreachable server, a password rotated in Key Vault but not on the server, or a
 * failed migration is declared healthy and takes 100% of traffic. This is what the readiness probe and
 * both deployment gates ask (PLAN-030 §8, review round 2 §2).
 *
 * `?deep=1` additionally checks that every migration this image ships has been applied, which is a
 * question only worth asking *after* migrations have run — the deploy script's gate, not the probe. On
 * a first run the app is created before the migration job runs, so the probe must not ask it. "Every
 * one it ships", not "the newest of them": see the note in `migrationsApplied`, where the difference is
 * what lets a rollback be promoted.
 *
 * The body says ready or not-ready and nothing else, because this route is unauthenticated: an
 * anonymous caller learns nothing about the host, the database or the driver's error from it.
