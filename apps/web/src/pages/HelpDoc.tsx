// ── PSA-style documentation frame (structure modeled on Autotask / ConnectWise Asio / HaloPSA docs) ──
// Sections are grouped: "core" (the four Help subsections) and "walkthroughs" (step-by-step
// feature guides).
//
// MAINTENANCE RULE — this file is part of the change, not a follow-up to it. Whenever a feature is
// added, updated, changed or removed:
//   1. update that feature's walkthrough below (or add one if it has none);
//   2. update its rows in the "index" section, and the relevant rows in "configuration";
//   3. add the question to "faq" if a user would plausibly ask it;
//   4. link the walkthrough from the sections it belongs beside.
// A walkthrough is reachable as soon as it is in this array (the route is /help/walkthroughs/:slug),
// so a new section needs no route or menu change — but it must be listed in the Index, because that
// is where people look for something they cannot name.
//
// PERMISSION GATE — a section, a block or a table row may carry `permission`. Where it does, that help
// does not exist for somebody who lacks it: not in the sidebar, not in the Index, not in the
// configuration reference, not in the FAQ, and not behind a typed URL. `helpVisible` is the one test and
// every place that enumerates HELP_SECTIONS applies it, which is what the `developer:view` gate needs.
// Keep gated content *in the array*: `scripts/check-help-links.mjs` reads this source and requires every
// walkthrough to be listed in the Index, so the gate is a filter rather than something deleted, and the
// check stays honest while the rows stay conditionally absent.

      { kind: "h", text: "Multi-factor authentication" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I am being asked for a second factor even though I never set one up. — A: You did set one up; the enrolment is recorded against your account, not your device, so it follows you to every browser and every machine. If you no longer have the app, use a **recovery code** — the codes you were shown when you enrolled, which work once each. If those are gone too, an administrator has to reset your second factor on your account, which clears it and asks you to set it up again." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: My authenticator code is always rejected. — A: The code is derived from the clock, so the usual cause is that the device running the app has drifted by more than thirty seconds. Set the phone's time to automatic and try the next code. The second usual cause is scanning the code from an old enrolment — every enrolment issues a new secret, so a screenshot of a previous QR code produces codes that will never match." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: The emailed code never arrives. — A: Somebody has to check the relay. An emailed code is the one method that depends on something outside the application, which is why it is off by default and why the deployment's mail settings are worth confirming before offering it. Ask the administrator to try it themselves — if the code arrives for them, the problem is the address on your account or a spam filter; if it does not arrive at all, the relay is the problem." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I set up MFA but I am still being told to set it up. — A: Check which method was finished. A passkey is registered from a signed-in session, so it cannot be the method that gets somebody in the door for the first time; an account with nothing enrolled has to choose the authenticator app or an emailed code first, and can add a passkey afterwards. If you enrolled and the message persists, the message is about a **different** account — an administrator can see on your user record which method is recorded and when." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why am I not asked for a code on my laptop but I am on my phone? — A: Because the laptop is **remembered**. After a second factor is proved, that browser may skip the second factor for a number of days (30 by default, and an administrator can set it to 0 to ask every time). It is a cookie in that one browser — a different browser, a private window, or a cleared cache all ask again. A reset of your second factor takes the trust away immediately." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: And why am I not asked at all, when a colleague is? — A: Either your account is **exempt** from the requirement (an administrator can mark one account as not required) or you are inside the **grace period** that a newly-enforced requirement gives everybody. Both are visible on your user record, and both are deliberate ways of not locking somebody out; only the second expires." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I see what my users will be shown before I switch this on? — A: Yes. **Administration → Configuration → Multi-factor authentication** has **Simulate a setup**, which reads what this instance actually does and steps through what a person sees in each situation — setting it up for the first time, being reminded inside the grace period, being stopped after it, signing in with a code, signing in with a code by email, and using a recovery code when a phone is lost. It writes nothing." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Navigation & workspace" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I keep the sections I use most at the top? — A: Yes. Right-click any section or subsection in the navigation and choose **Pin to Favorites**. It is a copy rather than a move — the section stays where it is, and a second copy of it appears under Favorites at the top of the pane, in an order you drag into place." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What else is in the navigation's right-click menu? — A: Whatever you right-clicked. A page offers Open, Open in new tab, Open in new window and Copy link; a section adds its own expand and collapse; a pinned copy adds Move up, Move down and Remove from Favorites; and right-clicking empty space gives Expand all, Collapse all and Remove all favorites." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I lost my place — how do I get back? — A: Press **Recent** in the header. It lists the last five things you changed and the pages you stayed on, and clicking one returns you to that exact place, flashing the spot you were working in. **Show All** opens the same history at length on your own **My Activity** page — also in the account menu, under **My Account → My Activity**." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I see what somebody else was doing? — A: Only with the audit permission, and only under **Administration → Audit Logs**, which records every change across the instance whoever made it. **My Activity** is deliberately only ever your own; it is not a filtered view of that page." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: My navigation looks different from a colleague's — is something wrong? — A: Probably not. The pane has two shapes, **rail and sections** and the **single tree**, and both are supported; the instance's default is set at Administration → Configuration → Workspace → **Navigation pane**. You can also disagree with it for your own browser, which is the quicker way: **My Account → Appearance → Navigation** switches the pane where you are standing, or the same thing from a console is `localStorage.setItem(\"c7_ui_nav\", \"0\"); location.reload()`, and `\"1\"` puts the rail back. Nothing about a page changes either way." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why has a section moved, or gone missing, in the navigation? — A: Two different things, and the pane tells you which. Rows you have never opened can fold into **Everything else** inside a section — counted, and one click away. A section that has moved is in another domain, and the filter at the top of the panel searches the whole application and shows where each hit lives. Nothing is ever removed: a destination the pane has not been told about appears under **Other** on the rail rather than disappearing." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: My colleague's screens look different from mine — is something wrong? — A: Probably not. The screens have two layouts, **Modern** and **Classic**, and both are supported; the instance's default is set at Administration → Configuration → Workspace → **Interface**. **My Account → Appearance → Interface** switches them where you are standing, in either direction, and nothing about a page changes either way — the same tabs hold the same panels. Your colour scheme and spacing are unaffected by the switch." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Where did the Configurations and Products tabs go? — A: They are still there, one click deeper: **Configurations** under *Finance*, and **Products** under *Work*, in the Modern screens. **My Account → Appearance → Interface → Classic** returns the single strip of twelve tabs. In both layouts a ticket's own tab is unchanged." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: The client list is showing cards rather than a table — can I have the table back? — A: Yes, and you do not have to change layout for it. **Clients** has a **Cards / Table** switch in its toolbar; Table is the six-column list you had before, Cards is the grid of client cards, and the switch remembers nothing, so either is one click away. Classic shows the table." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I stop scrolling so much on a ticket? — A: The Modern detail screen already spends less height on chrome: the header is one row rather than two, the actions sit on the same line as the tabs, and the sub-tabs sit under them — about 70px less before the panel begins — and the tab strip **stays pinned** while the panel scrolls, so the twelve panels are always one click away without going back to the top. Above that, the bar every page shares is one line instead of three, which is another **44px on every screen in the application**. **My Account → Appearance → Interface → Classic** returns the taller layout if you would rather have it, and **Preferences → Use compact spacing** tightens every table in the application." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Where has the breadcrumb in the top bar gone? — A: In the Modern interface it is not repeated there. The rail already shows where you are — the row for the section you are in stays lit — and a record that has somewhere to go back to carries its own trail on the page (a ticket reads *Tickets › its board › its number*). The bar above every page has room for either the trail or the description of the section, and at 1280px the description is the one worth spending the line on. **My Account → Appearance → Interface → Classic** puts the trail back where it was." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Tickets" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why was a ticket's priority changed automatically? — A: The priority deduction engine adjusts priority from keywords and SLA rules; you can override it manually." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I acknowledge or close many tickets at once? — A: Yes. Select the checkboxes on the left of the ticket list, then apply a batch action from the bulk bar." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What are the counts above the ticket list? — A: The **views**: All, Workable, Escalated, Waiting, On Hold and New. Each one is a filter you press rather than a dialog you fill in, and the number beside it says how many tickets it would show *before* you press it — so \"Waiting 17\" is a reason to look and \"Waiting\" is not. The counts are for the board and client you are looking at, not the whole instance. A view is held in the address, so the list can be linked to and it survives a reload, and **Filtered by** underneath still names every filter in force, including the ones a view set." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I see a ticket's priority without a column for it? — A: Tickets carry a thin coloured bar in front of the summary — grey for low, amber for medium, orange for high, red for critical — so priority is something you notice while reading the list rather than another column competing for width. Hovering it names the priority. Choose Columns still offers the priority column for anybody who sorts by it." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What is the Age and SLA column? — A: **Age** is how long the ticket has been open, in the compact form the queue is read in (34m, 4h, 2d). **SLA** is the clock: the board's SLA target — or the ticket's due date, if that is what your instance sets — as *\"3d to SLA\"* while there is time, amber inside four hours, and red as *\"SLA breached · 2d ago\"* once it has gone. Hovering either one shows the exact timestamp, and a ticket with neither a due date nor an SLA target shows a dash rather than a guess. **Age** is on by default; **SLA** ships hidden — **Choose Columns** adds it, and removes either, like any other column." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why do the rows in the ticket list no longer wrap? — A: Because a queue is read by scanning it, and a row three lines high cannot be scanned. The columns are measured against the tickets on screen and set to the width their content asks for, so a client name or a timestamp is shown whole on one line; whatever does not fit is trimmed with an ellipsis and the full value is in the tooltip. The text is a size smaller than it used to be for the same reason — the same columns fit in less width. If a column is still not the size you want, drag its right edge; if you would rather have fewer columns than narrower ones, Choose Columns turns them off." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I change a ticket's status without opening the Edit form? — A: Yes. In the Modern screens the ticket's states are **pills beside its title** — status, priority, assignee, source and the SLA clock. Press one and pick a value; it saves immediately, through the same route the Edit form uses, and everything it affects (the queue, the SLA, the audit trail) is updated the same way it always was. Use **Edit** when you want to change several fields at once or work with the full form." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can emails create tickets automatically? — A: Yes. Configure a monitored mailbox or M365 Graph connector under Administration → Service Boards → Email connectors." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I set up the Microsoft 365 app the connector needs? — A: Open the connector, choose **Microsoft 365 / Exchange Online** and **App-only (client secret)**, then press **Deploy OAuth app**. The wizard signs you in with a code, creates or reuses the registration, grants the Mail.ReadWrite application permission with admin consent, mints the secret, prints the Exchange Online scoping commands, and fills the connector's fields. You need Application Administrator (or Global Administrator) on the tenant, and you must run the Exchange commands — until they are run the app can read every mailbox in the tenant." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can one Microsoft 365 app watch several mailboxes? — A: Yes, and that is the normal shape: one registration consenting once, with an address per board (`alerts@` → NOC Alerts, `servicedesk@` → MSP Service Desk). Add the first one through **Deploy OAuth app**, then add each further address by choosing **Reuse …** under **Which Microsoft 365 app** and supplying only the mailbox and its board. Exchange has to be told about each address separately — open **Exchange scoping** on the app and run the commands it prints, which cover every address on it, or the new mailbox stays unreadable to the app." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does the app need Mail.ReadWrite and not Mail.Read? — A: Because the connector marks a message read once it has become a ticket. A read-only registration connects happily, reads the mailbox, and then fails on the first message it tries to mark — which is why the wizard refuses a registration that was granted Mail.Read." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Consent was granted but the connector still says AccessDenied — A: Consent takes 30–60 minutes to reach the mailbox layer. An immediate `ErrorAccessDenied` is expected rather than a misconfiguration; wait and test again before changing anything." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I use the script instead of the wizard? — A: Yes, and both are supported. `O365/New-C7NTAXMailboxApp.ps1` does the same work from a terminal and writes `out/c7ntax-m365-app.json`; paste that file into the wizard and it fills the same fields. The script is the reference if you want to see exactly which Graph calls are made." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Somebody cannot sign in and I need to know why — A: Open **Administration → Sign-in Audit**. Every attempt is there with its outcome, the reason, the device and the address: a wrong password, a locked account, a failed second factor, or an address that is not an account here. If the account is locked, five failures did it and the counter is cleared by unlocking the user." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I sign somebody out everywhere? — A: **Administration → Sign-in Audit → Active sessions**, then **Sign out everywhere** on any of their rows. To end one browser only, use **Revoke** on that row. Changing a password or disabling the account already ends every session as well; these buttons are for when you have not done either and need it now." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I remove a lost phone's passkey? — A: **Administration → Sign-in Audit → Devices** lists every passkey and notification subscription with the account it belongs to; the bin beside it removes it. A person can also do it themselves under **My Settings → Security** — the screen an administrator needs is the one for a device they cannot reach." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I change the wording of the emails the product sends? — A: Yes, at **Administration → Email Studio**. Every message the instance can send is listed there with the subject as it is written, what fires it and who reads it, and each one is editable as a template — its subject, its blocks and its merge fields — with a preview against a real ticket or invoice and a version history to go back to. A few are exceptions and the screen says which: the sign-in verification code, the portal sign-in code and the account invitation have their **body locked** (only the sender and the footer may change), because a one-time code is read once in a hurry and decorating it is how a legitimate message comes to look like a phishing attempt." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Does that break the plain-text version of an email? — A: No — every message is sent with both parts. The text is derived from the same blocks as the HTML, so the two cannot carry different facts, and a button in the text part shows the full address rather than hiding it behind link text. Somebody may edit the text part by hand; the Studio then marks the message **plain text overridden** and warns when the two parts carry different figures or URLs." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Does the customer get told when their ticket changes? — A: Yes. A customer note, a time entry or a status change emails the ticket's customer contact — an internal note does not. Closing is the one notification with an instruction in it rather than a report: see **Closing a ticket** below." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I closed a ticket but the client replied — what happens? — A: It reopens by itself. A reply from one of the client's own contacts on a closed, resolved or cancelled ticket puts it back in the queue with the status **Customer reopened**, records the reply on the ticket, and leaves a line in the thread saying why. The status is deliberately not *In Progress*: a ticket that was declared finished and came back is not the same as one that was never finished, and folding them together hides the tickets that were closed too early. A reply from anyone who is not a client contact — a vendor, a colleague, one of our own technicians — is recorded without reopening." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why would I close a ticket without emailing the client? — A: Because the email is not always the right thing: the contact may have left, the ticket may be a duplicate, or it may have been opened by mistake. Close it with the **Close silently** choice (untick *Email the client* in the classic screens) and the ticket settles with nothing sent — the closing note is still recorded on the ticket either way, so the record of why does not depend on whether anybody was told." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why did a ticket close without emailing my client? — A: Because its **board** is set not to, and the dialog offered **Close silently** as the default. That setting exists for the NOC Alerts board: those tickets arrive from monitoring systems, and a closure email to a no-reply address is a message to nobody that looks like a notification. Turn it back on per board under Administration → Service Boards, or pick **Email the client** in the dialog for a single closure." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Which boards close a ticket without emailing the client? — A: Open **Service Boards** and read the rail: each board says it in words — **emails the client on close**, or **closes without emailing the client** — and the selected board's own page repeats the answer beside the two choices the close dialog offers, with the table beneath comparing the closing email, the SLA clocks, auto-close and follow-up across every board at once. See the Service Boards walkthrough." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Our RMM raises the same alert every minute — will that be sixty tickets? — A: No. Send it to the event gateway (POST /api/events) with your own stable id for the condition and the first one opens a ticket while the rest are added to it as notes with an occurrence count. Send `kind: \"recovery\"` and the ticket resolves. See API Access & the Event Gateway." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can our SIEM (or monitoring platform) create tickets? — A: Yes — issue it an API key on Administration → API Access with just **ticket:create** and **ticket:view**, and have it POST to /api/events. The key can do nothing else, and it loses even that the moment the account behind it does." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I use the API from a script of my own? — A: Yes. Anything the application does is a documented operation: issue a key, send it as `Authorization: Bearer …`, and the reference is docs/API.md with the generated specification at docs/openapi.yaml. For a person at a keyboard, a session token from sign-in works on the same header." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What happens if an API key leaks? — A: Rotate it. Rotation issues a new secret and invalidates the old one immediately, and both are in the audit log. The leaked value is worthless before the rotation finishes only if you are unlucky; the point of rotation is that it never needs to be recovered, because the stored hash cannot be reversed." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can a solved ticket write the knowledge base article? — A: It can draft one. Open a resolved ticket and ask for a draft; it is filed unpublished, with the ticket number attached, for a person to review." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Clients & contacts" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Where do I find everybody at a client, and what they have raised? — A: **Clients → Contacts**, the address book by client. The rail narrows the list to one view or one client, every row carries the person and their client with how many tickets they have raised and how many are still open, and selecting somebody opens the sheet: their client's weight, what they have raised with the newest tickets linking through, whether they can sign in to the portal, the last thing recorded against them, and the four things you do from here." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Somebody has left — how do I stop them signing in to the portal? — A: **Clients → Contacts**, select the person, and turn on **Refuse the portal to this person** under **Signing in to the portal**. It refuses that person alone: it holds whether or not their client's portal is on, and it would still refuse them if the client's portal were switched on tomorrow. **What they would see** beside it overrules the client's own answer for one person. Both controls are offered to whoever may change the portal's settings; turning the client's own portal off is the blunter answer, because it takes the portal away from everybody at that client." },

       */
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why is the Developer Admin role missing from my roles list, and why can I not see the person who holds it? — A: Because only a **Super Admin** is shown either one. Two permissions, `developer:view` and `developer:purge`, are the only ones whose worst case is removing what this instance holds, so the role that carries them — and the account wearing it — belong to a Super Admin alone: an ordinary administrator sees no Developer line in a role list, no Developer category in a permission picker, and no such account in Manage Users, in a picker, in a filter or in an export. The API answers the same way and names what it refused: fetching the role gives `404` rather than a blank version of it, and setting `developer:view` on a role gives `Refused: developer:view. Only a Super Admin may see or set the Developer Admin role and the developer permissions.` A **Developer Admin** is not a Super Admin for this purpose either, so it cannot widen its own role. A Super Admin sees and edits all of it normally.", permission: Permission.DeveloperView },
      { kind: "h", text: "Console" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why can't I see the Console button? — A: One of three switches is closed. Your account must hold `console:use` (Administration → Users & Roles → Console), your client must not have the console turned off (its own record has the switch), and the deployment must have it on (Configuration → Workspace → Command console). All three answers are the same to the interface: no button, and a `/console` link lands on a refusal rather than a console." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: If somebody has the permission, can they run everything? — A: No. `console:use` decides whether they get a console at all; each command is then filtered by the permission it needs, so a technician types `help` and sees the commands their account may use. The API answers the same way — a command a key or a person may not run is refused rather than hidden." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can we turn the console off for one client without touching everyone else? — A: Yes. Open the client, and on its Console card tick **Disable the console for every member of this client**. Only people who belong to that client lose it; your own staff are unaffected. It needs `system:config`." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can the console change data? — A: Not yet. Every command reads today; write commands arrive with PLAN-026's action manifest, and they will appear in the same catalogue with the permission each one needs." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I preferred the console's old output — can I get it back? — A: Yes. **Advanced** in the console's header prints the route's field names in the route's own order, one per line, with every declared column and the values exactly as they arrived (raw timestamps, `true`/`false`). Basic lays the same result out to be read; Advanced shows what the route actually said. The choice is remembered for this browser, and switching it redraws output that is already on screen." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: The table is missing a column I expected — A: A column that holds nothing in every row is left out and the footer says how many were: three em dashes down a whole table is noise, not information. The data is untouched, `--json` prints the route's response exactly as it was sent, and **Advanced** shows the column." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can the console pop-up be made bigger? — A: Yes. Drag its right edge, its bottom edge or the bottom-right corner, and the size is remembered for that browser. Double-click the corner for the default size, or focus it and press the arrow keys (Shift for bigger steps). The `/console` page fills its column instead." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Sign-in & sessions" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why was I signed out? — A: The session ended after 30 minutes of inactivity. The sign-in page says the session timed out rather than showing a generic error, and in future a countdown warning appears a minute before it does." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I stay signed in longer? — A: Yes, but not per person: an administrator can change the timeout under Settings (5–480 minutes). No session lives longer than 12 hours whatever the setting." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does my colleague never get timed out? — A: Administrators and super-admins are exempt from the inactivity timeout. It is a role, not a personal preference." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I am locked out and need to get back in. — A: AUTH_HARDENING_ENABLED locks an account after 5 failed sign-ins. For diagnosis there is a single named test-exemption account (AUTH_TEST_BYPASS) that skips the lockout, the timeout, the password-change gate **and the multi-factor enrolment requirement**; it refuses to run in production and should be unset everywhere real." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Passwords" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What does the system require of a new password? — A: Five rules, and they are the same everywhere a password is set — the New User dialog, an administrator's reset, and you changing your own. **At least 12 characters.** **Three of: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols.** **Not a common password** (the words that lead every credential-stuffing list are refused by name). **Not your own name or email address**, because those are the first things anybody guessing will try. **Not a single repeated character.** The form shows these as a checklist that ticks as you type, so you can see which one is stopping you." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why will it not let me go back to my old password? — A: Because **the last five are remembered**, and reuse is what actually defeats a rule that wants passwords changed — an account alternating between two favourites satisfies every complexity rule forever while never really changing anything. It applies to an administrator's reset as well as to your own change, because \"put it back how it was\" is exactly how a change made after a password was exposed gets quietly undone. A **generated** reset password is exempt: it is random, so it cannot be a reuse." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Where did my old passwords go? — A: Nowhere they can be read. The history is stored as **hashes**, like the current password, so it can answer \"have you used this before\" without the system holding the password itself. Nothing — no screen, no export, no API response — ever returns it." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Billing, expenses & catalog" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does a printed invoice look different from the Billing screen? — A: Because paper is not a screen. The invoice is drawn as a white sheet in fixed millimetres and points, with the instance's letterhead, so it reads and prints the same everywhere and under any colour scheme — and a document a customer files is allowed to look like a document. If you change your logo or your colours under **Administration → System Branding**, the next invoice you open carries the new ones." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: An invoice was paid in part — will the customer be chased for the full amount? — A: No. The invoice states the **balance** the payments leave, not the gross total, and the totals block shows *Less payments applied* with the payments listed beside it." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I invoice unbilled ticket time? — A: Either the Finance Dashboard's **Generate draft invoice** for one client, or the bill-through batch, which previews a whole period across clients before creating anything." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can the batch double-bill somebody? — A: No. The preview only considers time and expenses that are not already on an invoice, and creating the batch marks them. Rejecting the batch clears the marks and deletes the drafts, so the work is picked up again next time." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How does a technician claim back a cost they paid for? — A: On the ticket's Expenses tab. It is filed as pending, and somebody with billing-manage approves or rejects it — and a rejection has to say why." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Where does a quote's price come from? — A: The Product Catalog. Search a line item by name or SKU and the description and sell price are copied in, so the price quoted and the price invoiced are the same number." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why can't my technician see what an item cost us? — A: Cost and margin are only returned to accounts holding the catalog's manage permission — the sell price is what someone attaching an item needs. It is enforced on the server, not hidden in the interface." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why can't I delete a product? — A: Because it has been quoted, ordered or billed. Deleting it would leave a record pointing at an SKU that no longer exists, so retire it instead — it leaves the pickers and every existing record keeps its numbers." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Branding & documents" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: I uploaded a logo but an invoice still shows the company name in type. — A: Three things to check, in order. The logo is only real once you have pressed **Save the brand** — picking the file is a draft, and Discard throws it away. A document reads the record **when it is produced**, so the invoice you are looking at may have been opened before the save. And the family's **letterhead** decides whether an image is drawn at all: a family set to *Nothing* or *The wordmark* draws the company name in type on purpose (that is the whole point of those choices), and *The logo* falls back to the icon and then to the wordmark when there is no artwork to draw." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why will it not accept my SVG? — A: Because an SVG is not an image here — it is a script with an image's extension, and the logo is fetched by whoever opens the document or the email, so it would run wherever the logo is shown. It is refused by name, and the refusal arrives at the picker rather than after an upload. Export a **PNG** from the design tool instead. PNG, JPEG and WebP are accepted, up to 2 MB." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why can't I change the colour of the document's text? — A: Because that is where a brand kit stops and a stylesheet begins. The document's **ink, its body text and its rules are fixed**, and an instance that set its body text to its own mid-tone accent would produce an invoice nobody can read, with no way to find out until a customer said so. You own two colours: the **primary**, which is the one a printed page uses and which the screen warns you about below 3:1 against white, and the **accent**, which is for the interface and email and is deliberately never printed." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I stop one client's invoice carrying our logo? — A: **Administration → System Branding → Client Branding**, open the client, and give it its own logo — its documents then draw that and nothing else changes. Note that a client with **no logo of its own wears its portal logo**, so a client you intend to look unbranded needs its own mark set rather than an empty box. A client's brand reaches its invoices, quotes and statements; the portal's own colour and welcome message are set separately under Customer Portal." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does an invoice still carry our old colours after we changed them? — A: Because a document is rendered on demand rather than stored with a copy of the record, so the next invoice or PDF you open carries the new ones and anything already downloaded is a file that has left. There is no second copy of the brand to update; if a document looks stale, re-open it." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Who can change the branding? — A: Reading is `branding:view` and changing it is `branding:manage`, both held by **Admin** and **Super Admin** and both deliberately outside the Developer permissions. Somebody with the read permission sees the pages and the previews with every control disabled and the permission it would need named beside it." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: The report came out landscape and I wanted portrait. — A: The paper is asked for **at the moment of export**: the report output chooser offers Print, PDF, Excel and CSV, and within it the paper size, the orientation and whether the basis block prints. That choice applies to the one export you are making and starts from the family's default, so if a whole family should be portrait, set it once under **Administration → System Branding → Document Branding** and stop answering the question." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Will changing the logo change documents we have already sent? — A: No — and it does not need to. Every document is drawn from the record when it is produced, so nothing is stored with a picture of the old letterhead; what has already been emailed or downloaded is a file that has left, and the next one you produce wears the new identity." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Reporting" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does a report say a figure is unknown instead of showing a number? — A: Because it genuinely cannot be known from the data, and estimating it would be inventing a number. Where a figure is incomplete the report says what is missing — how many hours carry no cost rate, for example." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Which period does a business review use? — A: The last **finished** one, and it compares like for like: a period still in progress is measured against the same number of days of its predecessor, never against the whole of it." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I build my own report? — A: Yes — Reporting → Custom Reports → New designed report. Bands, expressions, totals, charts and sub-reports, exported as Print, PDF, Excel or CSV, or scheduled as a PDF." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does Analytics say utilisation is \"not measured\"? — A: Because utilisation needs a period with real dates — it is hours worked against the capacity those hours fell in. Choose a month, a quarter or a year and it becomes a percentage; leave the period as all time and there is no capacity to divide by, so the screen says so rather than guessing." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why does agreement margin read 100%? — A: Because no cost rate is set on your technicians, so labour costs nothing and every margin on the screen reads high. The figure is marked **Unreliable** and the reason is printed under it. Record a cost rate per technician and the margin becomes real." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What is the client health score out of, and is anyone told? — A: It is 0 to 100, weighing the age of the oldest open ticket, the share of the load that is high priority, how much of what was invoiced is still out, and whether anything has been collected. It is a reading of your own data for your own triage — nothing is sent to the client, and the reasons behind a score are shown when you hover it." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Companion clients (C7NC)" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How do I get the Outlook add-in? — A: C7NC → Outlook Add-in, and press Download the installer. It is per-user and needs no administrator rights. Close and reopen Outlook afterwards — the add-in list is read once at start-up, so a running Outlook will not show the button." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can I see the add-in before installing it? — A: Yes. Administration → Configuration → Client Apps & Notifications → **Open the simulator** shows the add-in's own pane in a separate window with example emails, so the questions, the review and the result can be walked through with nothing created, sent or saved. It needs the add-in switched on, because it is served from the add-in's own address." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: What does “Bundle into one ticket” do? — A: It makes one ticket from a whole conversation: you choose which message the ticket is written from, and the others are saved on it as `.eml` files you can open later. The alternative, **One ticket each**, makes a separate ticket for every message." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: An add-in update caused trouble — how do I go back? — A: C7NC → Outlook Add-in keeps every installer version, each with its own Download: the release in use leads under **Latest Release**, and everything it replaced is kept together below it under **Previous Versions**. Install the earlier package over the current one and restart Outlook. Entries marked **Older plugin files** were built from a different set of add-in files, so they are the candidates when a recent change is at fault." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: The add-in installed but shows an empty pane — A: Almost always an installer built for a different server, which registers a manifest pointing somewhere the taskpane does not exist. C7NC → Outlook Add-in compares the address the installer was built for against this server's and shows the rebuild command when they differ." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Why can't I download the manifest from the repository? — A: Because the file on disk still holds the `__ADDIN_HOST__`, `__ADDIN_GUID__` and `__ADDIN_VERSION__` placeholders, and Office rejects a manifest whose URLs are not absolute — silently. Download it from the page instead, where the server has already replaced the placeholders with its own address and plugin version." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Integrations & alerts" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Where do I fix a broken integration? — A: C7NC shows live connection status; fix credentials inline and re-test without leaving the page. With live status on, a chip means \"last verified\", not \"last saved\"." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can outages open tickets automatically? — A: Alert webhooks POST each alert as it opens and closes, signed with the endpoint's own secret, so your automation can raise the ticket — or do anything else — the moment it happens." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: A single poll failed — will the alert flap? — A: No. Auto-resolution needs two consecutive all-clear polls and a minimum alert age, so one transient fetch gap cannot open and close an alert." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can social chatter raise an outage? — A: No. Chatter can only ever raise an informational notice, never an outage — it is a signal, not proof. And a post has to name the service to count for it, so a post about something else cannot raise a notice or retire one." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Customer Portal" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: How does a customer sign in? — A: They enter their email address at /portal and we email a six-digit code. It works once and expires in ten minutes, so there is no customer password to manage." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: A customer says the portal does not recognise them. — A: Their company needs **Portal access** switched on under Clients, and their email address must be one of that company's contacts." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Can a customer see anything they should not? — A: No. The restriction is applied on the server from the signed-in contact's company, after anything the request asked for. A ticket that is not theirs answers 404 rather than 403, because whether it exists is itself information." },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Does a customer see internal notes? — A: No. Internal notes are never sent to the portal." },
      { kind: "h", text: "Kumo & security" },
      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Are passwords encrypted? — A: Yes — Kumo stores passwords AES-256 encrypted, with TOTP and access logs." },

      { kind: "p", text: "Q: Does the product disable a departed user's Microsoft 365 account? — A: No, deliberately. The inactivity report finds dormant accounts and an offboarding raises an ordered checklist with an owner and a record; a human still does the disabling, in the tenant, where the consequence of a mistake is visible." },
